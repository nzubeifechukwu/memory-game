# Memory Cards

Memory Cards is a card game that tests how much you can remember. You click on a card to increase your score. You have to remember every card you have clicked on in each round. Clicking any card twice in a round resets the game. Your best score across rounds is preserved to give you an idea of how good (or bad) your memory is.
